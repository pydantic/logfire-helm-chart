{{- if .Values.ingress.enabled }}
You can access Logfire at: {{ include "logfire.url" . }}
{{- else }}
Logfire is not exposed through an ingress. To access the application, you can:

1. Port-forward the frontend service:
   kubectl port-forward svc/logfire-service 8080:8080 -n {{ .Release.Namespace }}
Then access:
  - http://localhost:8080
{{- end }}

Or set up your own Ingress / tunneling to these services.

{{- if .Values.dev.deployPostgres }}
A PostgreSQL database has been deployed as part of this installation.
{{- else }}
You are using an external PostgreSQL database.
{{- end }}

When configuring authentication with an external provider, set the redirect URI to:
- {{ printf "%s/auth-api/callback" (include "logfire.url" .) }}

An admin account was created with access to Logfire's own internal observability.
The email address used is {{ .Values.adminEmail }}.
You'll need to reset the password to log in.
This admin account has no special access over other accounts or new organizations / projects you might create.
